# App Usage Terms and Conditions

### Risks of using mStable

Using mStable comes with risks. Before doing so, it is best to research and understand the risks involved. These risks fall across the following services:

* Using the mStable contracts to mint, swap, and redeem stablecoins
* Using the mStable contracts to deposit or withdraw mAssets from Save
* Using the mStable EARN contracts for liquidity mining
* Using the mStable Staking contracts to stake MTA

Users should do their own research depending on what they intend to use the mStable protocol for. Do not supply funds that you cannot afford to lose either to mStable as a liquidity provider or as a holder of mAssets.

#### Audits

mStable's code is rigorously tested and has undergone various audits to test the security of the protocol. However, security audits do not completely eliminate smart contract risk. You can find out more about our audits in the [Security](../protocol/security/) section.

#### Permanent loss of a bAsset peg

If one of the stablecoins being used as a bAsset in the mStable basket experiences a significant price movement below its peg without returning, it will effectively mean that the mStable contracts hold a portion of that bAsset at maximum weight. Those holding the corresponding mAsset could in this scenario experience a loss of value of the associated mAsset token.
