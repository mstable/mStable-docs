# Basket Adjustment

* Meta Governors can alter bAsset maximum weights according to new market conditions or information.
* Meta Governors control the addition/removal of bAssets and set their maximum weights.
* A Basket Adjustment occurs when Meta Governors choose to change the maximum weight of a bAsset.
* Secondly, a basket adjustment can occur when a bAsset is deemed unfit for inclusion. In this case, Meta Governors will be able to remove that bAsset entirely.
