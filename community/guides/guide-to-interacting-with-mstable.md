* Send the transaction
* Verify the mAsset \(e.g. mUSD\) minted in your wallet

### Toggling between mAssets \(mUSD &lt;&gt; mBTC\)

### Depositing mAssets into Save

* Head over to [Save](https://app.mstable.org/#/musd/save)
* Head down to Deposit
* Select the input asset to deposit \(e.g. mUSD, USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD, GUSD\)
  * When selecting non mAssets, mStable will first **Mint** the mAsset
* Click **Save** \(if depositing via mAssets\) or **Mint and Save**
* Approve the contract to spend your tokens if it's your first time interacting with the contract
* Click Save or Mint and Save again
* Send the transaction
* Done! You have deposited into Save

_Your Savings are tokenised in the form of imAssets \(e.g. imUSD, imBTC\) which increase in value over time_

### Depositing mAssets into the Save Vault

* When depositing mAssets into Save, you have the option of depositing into Save \(e.g. imUSD\) or the Save Vault \(e.g. imUSD Vault\)
* Depositing into the Vault earns you additional MTA and/or ecosystem rewards in addition to swap/lending interest
* Click on the dropdown in the output to switch to Vault deposit

### Withdrawing from Save

* Head over to [Save](https://app.mstable.org/#/musd/save)
* Head down to Redeem
* Select the amount of imAssets to withdraw
* Click Withdraw
* Send the transaction

_If your assets are in the Save Vault, you need to first unstake them from the Vault before you can withdraw_

### Redeeming mAssets \(e.g. mUSD\) for underlying assets

* Head over to Exchange
* Click on the Redeem tab
* Select the mAsset to redeem
* Select amount to redeem
* Select output asset \(e.g. USDC, USDT\) or switch to multi-asset redemption to redeem into multiple underlying assets
* Click Redeem

_Fees for redemption are 0.03% for multiple asset redeems and 0.02% for single asset redeems and go to Save deposits_

### Swapping between assets

mStable also has an underlying AMM that allows underlying assets in its basket to be swapped

* Head over to Exchange
* Click on the Swap tab
* Choose the input and output currencies
* Enter the amount to swap
* Verify the exchange rate, swap fees, and penalty

_Fees for swaps are currently 0.02% and goes to Save deposits_

### Tracking balances and value

There are a couple of ways to track your balances. Since mAssets and imAssets are all ERC-20 tokens in their own right, you can track them like how you'd track any other ERC-20 token on the blockchain.

You can track them on mStable:

* On the Account modal
  * Click on your address on the top navigation bar
  * Scroll to find a consolidated view of your balances including mAssets, imAssets and bAssets
* On the Save homepage
  * If you have deposited in Save, you can find your Save balance in the Save homepage

Or on external platforms like Zapper.Fi, Zerion and DeBank.

### Staking

**New Stake**

* Head over to the [Governance](https://governance.mstable.org/#/govern) page
* Click on the Stake tab
* Under Add amount enter the amount of MTA to stake
* Choose how long to stake
* Click lock up and stake MTA

**Extend or Add Stake**

* Click on the Add Amount or Extend lock tab
* Click lock up and stake MTA
