# Process for Community Grants

The communityDAO is responsible for managing the approval and distribution of grants.

The current process is as follows:

* An applicant fills in a grant form \(coming soon!\) detailing the request
* For grants above US$500, the request must come with the value it brings, an execution plan, timeline, deliverables, budget and background about the requestor
* For grants above US$5000, the grant would also need to be socialised via the monthly community call and then routed to [Discor​​d](https://discord.com/invite/pgCVG7e) where community members can vote
* A communityDAO reviews requests bi-monthly and approves by majority vote
* Once approved, the grantee is appointed a coordinator to liaise with on the specifics of the grant
* Once completed to specification, agreed rewards may then be disbursed

_This process may be improved upon by any member of the community._
